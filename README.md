# RDF Surfaces 

This repository was used by the RDF Surfaces Community Group, which closed in February 2026.
At the time the group was closed, discussion had migrated; see the [new repo](https://github.com/KNowledgeOnWebScale/rdfsurfaces).

## Original description
The group set out to create a sublanguage of [Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/)
in order to implement classical first-order logic with negation in RDF as envisioned by Pat Hayes
in his 2009 ISWC Invited Talk: [BLOGIC](https://www.slideshare.net/PatHayes/blogic-iswc-2009-invited-talk).
